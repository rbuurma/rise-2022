### Follow up on McKeon

Briefly recap McKeon dynamic and what he adds; put diagram back on board

Question: "deep and enabling analogy between questions of truth and questions of virtue"

What you think of the idea that literary forms have content?

What do you think of the idea that literary forms have political content?

The alternative, of course, is to say that a novel's narrative style can take on any form, isn't inherently supporting a middle-class ideology or an aristocratic ideology.

First: can we use Fielding to figure out this question?

Second: What do we think? Can we think of any contemporary examples?

### Evelina

Transition: with Evelina, the novel has risen (according it Watt)

*We've been thinking about this question, which relateds esp to McKeon: how do we value the lives of everyday people? how do we narrative the lives of everyday people? If our argument is that the novel is a form that does this for the first time, where are we now?*

Let's track this in Evelina - but also lets hold that thought in mind in the present.

Introduction to Evelina : a novel that has its roots in Pamela (epistolarity, focus on a young woman’s coming of age, titled with the name of that woman) - a girl from the provinces going to London. And  there are many moments that parallel Pamela (and perhaps make light of Pamela?); Mr. Villars writing to say he wishes she wouldn't stay in London and her brushing him off; 107-111, the carriage ride with Willoughby; etc

UPDATE THIS
But they are comic parallels, and Evelina develops more as social comedy than as domestic drama - and its descendents in Sex and the City and reality shows like The Hills and The City (note that these shows take the female subjectivity/perspective for granted and name the place) or Girls (interesting generic name) or ???. All the "Girls" novels are a reaction - Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc?

What’s NEW about Evelina? For one thing, it is the first novel we’ve read that its first readers would have been able to call a novel. Does Evelina seem more familiar to us?   (Evelina vs the captain as realistic characters – ? I’d say also B vs Pamela, in the world of manners not morals) Compare the preface of Evelina to those of RC and Pam.

To think back to McKeon, as I suggested we might, part of what’s new about Evelina is that it has the tools to manage the “deep and fruitful analogy between questions of truth and questions of virtue” that “is the enabling foundation of the novel.”

For Richardson and the readers who responded so strongly to Pamela, narrative questions of truth and moral questions of virtue seemed difficult to separate; the outrage over the fictionality of Pamela was inseparable from the question of the characters' virtue or hypocrisy, and we saw that the steps Richardson took to mitigate such critiques also failed to draw a distinction between moral and narrative integrity. [The fact that the novel and the character are so difficult to distinguish between becomes part of this problem.]

However, for Evelina (similarly titled with a girl's first name), problems of narrative and problems of morality – I want to claim – are neatly separate all the better to uphold the ANALOGY. (In Pam, it collapses.)

Whereas Pamela creates narrative reasons/excuses for Pamela to literally wear her writing on her body (a wearing which nearly becomes B’s excuse to undress Pamela in the pursuit of reading rather than sex), and where Pamela’s writing is imagined in several ways to have direct social effects (within the narrative in its circulation to B and Davers as well as outside the narrative in its role as a conduct guide), Evelina separates the two. (Also note Sham.)

To put it another way, perhaps in Evelina, innocence is both a moral/social and a narrative category, but the two do not collapse.

*** And the novel is extremely explicit about this - look at Mr. Villars's letter to Miss Mirvan

***Talk about Evelina the character vs Pam the character - and their respective relations to the novels named for them

Agree? Disagree?

Examples of the novel's epistolary form? How does it differ from Pamela's, so far?

Assign exercise 4 - due next F - exercise 5 I'll assign next week, will be due after break. DEscribe - learn about ECCO repository and the technology that created it.

### Tristram Shandy and form/content

We talked Monday about how Evelina seems like a novel to us in a way that RC and Pam didn't; we've of course skipped a lot, including an experimental moment in the 1750s and 60s defined by the digressive Tristram Shandy

[put dates on board]

the marbled page, the black page - in relation to the history of the novel?

Surface and depth:

Think about the novel’s dramatization of the arbitrary link between surface and depth (vs Evelina’s misreading of it – see page 29 on ‘good company” and “dressed” – but she learns from Orville that (35) manners and understanding are more important

//perhaps remember end of Armstrong on surface and depth

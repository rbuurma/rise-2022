## Assignment 5: Rewriting the History of the Novel with GPT-3

### Very Large Language Models

Recent years have seen a lot of dicussion about the [dangers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)and possibilites](https://tedunderwood.com/) of large language models (LMs). LMs are a type of natural language processing (NLP) that "learn" from a large existing corpus of texts and then can be used to "predict" the likelihood of a token (for example, a letter or word) that will appear next (or in its context). In simple language, these models can be used to generate new text based on what they know about how the language in their training corpora behaves. Some of the dangers and risks of using and coming to rely on LMs include the environmental impact and cost of the energy required to run them, the tendency of LMs to silently reproduce the inequalities and stereotypes of their source texts while seeming to be "neutral," objective," or "unbiased" sources of writing. They also introduce the danger that human users will unintentially plagiarize the source texts the models reply on. Yet they also promise to denaturalize the writing process in a way that allows us to see our own human writing anew, and perhaps helping us create new and exciting texts.

### Rewriting the Novel

In this text exercise, you will

1. Find the OpenAI email you received last week and set up an account.

2. Navigate to the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).

3. Choose three of the novels we've read - one from the 18th, one from the 19th, and one from the 20th century. Gather some sentences you would like the mdoel to complete - perhaps opening sentences or paragraphs, perhaps final sentences, perhaps a favorite line or opening sentence of a chapter.

4. Choose a [model](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/finding-the-right-model), look at the settings on the righthand side, learn about what they do, and adjust them. (Please DO NOT raise the "best of" option high or use it often, as it will run through our collective request allowance quickly.)

5. For each of your chosen novels, paste in your sentences and press submit. Save the resulting text. If you like, adjust the settings and see what changes.

6. In a few paragraphs, speculate on how the model generated the text you see, compare it to the actual lines that follow (if you are not working with final lines), and ask if there seem to be significant differences between the model's generation of text based on the 18th, 19th, and 20th c novel prompts. Consider, too, what the model seems to identify as or know about fiction or "the novel," if anything.

### Example

I prompted the model with the first line of *The the Lighthouse* (but note that you can put in the same prompt and get something different):

> "Yes, of course, if it's fine tomorrow," said Mrs. Ramsay. "But you'll have to be up with the lark," she added.

And I received this:

>It seemed that the party of Colonel Elliot's was to go fishing at five in the morning.

>The thought of it offended Mr. Bankes, who certainly was not going to get up at five in the morning.

>"At that early hour?" said Mr. Bankes.

>"Jamieson tells me the fish are biting best then," said Colonel Elliot.

>"That's rot," said Mr. Ramsay.

>"That's one of Jamieson's old wives' tales," said Mr. Carmichael, and he lifted his head, and began to think aloud, repeating a line of Latin verse which he had forgotten altogether till this moment.

>"If that is true," cried Mrs. Ramsay, interrupting, "let us go out in the boat tonight, and fish."

>It was one of her greatest delights to be in a boat, relaxing, knocking things about.

>"No, no," she said, declining all offers. "Somebody has got to stay with the children."

>"I'll stay with the children," said Mr. Minta.

>"But," she said, "somebody has got to go to the Lighthouse."

What has the model identified correctly - if we were to imagine the task as to continue to write a novel that Woolf MIGHT have written? What does it miss? What might (or might not) we learn if we compare what comes next in Woolf with the text the model generated.

### Extra credit 1

Read the article and blog post linked above, and well as seek out more information on these language models by yourselve, in order to then meditate (even tentatively) on what they might be good for and what their dangers might be. This extra credit assignment is obviously open-ended; you might write a few paragraphs prompted by one of these questions, or do something more extensive.

### Extra credit 2

Create a new Rise of the Novel Text Exercise using OpenAI's GPT-3 interface or another similar interface. You might do this briefly in a paragraph that just sketches a clear idea, or more extensively.
